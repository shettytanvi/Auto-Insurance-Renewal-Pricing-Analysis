# Analysis of Auto Insurance Renewals & Pricing Elasticity
## Objective & Problem Statement
This project aimed to analyze key factors influencing auto insurance renewal rates and pricing elasticity. With increasing competition in the insurance market, the goal was to help insurers optimize pricing strategies by understanding how demographics, tenure, and price changes impact policy renewals.

## Methods & Tools Used
### Data Processing: 
Cleaned and transformed a dataset with 13 variables, handling missing values and biases.
### Statistical Analysis: 
Used descriptive statistics, correlation tests (Pearson), T-tests, and ANOVA to identify significant relationships.
### Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression & Random Forest predicted policy renewals.
ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) & AUC (Area Under Curve) validated model accuracy.
Confusion Matrix evaluated performance.
### Data Visualization: 
Used ggplot2 in R to analyze trends across gender, marital status, tenure, and pricing effects.
My Role & Responsibilities
I worked on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical testing, and model development. My key contributions included implementing logistic regression, analyzing statistical test results, and visualizing data trends. Additionally, I helped interpret findings and draft insights for business recommendations.

## Collaboration & Contribution
This was a team project where I contributed to model implementation, statistical analysis, and reporting. I played a crucial role in analyzing price sensitivity and its effect on renewals.

## Outcomes & Impact
### Findings:
Percentage change in price had a greater impact on renewal rates than absolute price.
Married females were more likely to renew policies, while unmarried males had lower renewal rates.
Longer tenure increased the likelihood of renewal.
Pricing Recommendations: To improve retention, insurers should minimize drastic price hikes.
Model Performance: Achieved 60.59% accuracy, providing moderate predictive power.
Business Implications: Findings helped refine pricing models, improve customer retention, and enhance competitive pricing strategies.
